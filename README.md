A browser extension designed to interact with prediction market platforms (like Polymarket), automatically detecting the active markets. It will scrape relevant market data and then use multiple news connectors to gather pertinent news articles related to those markets. The plugin will process the sentiment of this news data, providing users with a sentiment score or analysis for the market in question. This will help users assess the potential outcomes of the market based on current events and sentiment, giving them a more informed view before making their predictions.
